## Characteristics of a TOR traffic

- TLS encryption  
-  It only has Common Name in the certificate  
-  Certificate Subject Common Name is www.{random}.net. Example.  www.2wcddc5755jllu.net  
-  Certificate Issuer Common name is www.{random}.com.  
-  SNI (if available) is www.{random}.com and usually wonâ€™t resolve. Example: www.b57efm9h06hb331njjd.com
